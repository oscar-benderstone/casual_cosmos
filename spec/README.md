# Specification

> [!WARNING]
> This specification is still work in progress!
> Several things will likely change:
>
> - The documentation system.
> - A linking system from the (semi-formal) specification
>   to the guide.
> - Overall game modes and features.
>
> Once the core features have been established,
> this warning will be replaced with a notice of
> backwards-compatibility. (New features can be added,
> but old features will _always_ be supported).

This folder specifies Casual Cosmos, from UI elements,
game modes, and overall functionality.

There are two key resources to consult:

- The [official guide](./GUIDE.md). Best for players
  or people who want to quickly edit the config format.
  - Included in the game (TBA).
- The semi-formal [specification](./SPEC.md). This is useful for maintainers
  of the official program or alternative implementations.
  (Still handy for board games!).
  - Only available in this repository.

Eventually, both documents will be synced, making
it easier to maintain and minimize errors.
